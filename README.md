# Air Quality Monitoring and Anomaly Detection System

## Project description 
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques and capabilities to detect anomalies on air quality data and predict air quality trends. It aims to address the problem of forecasting air pollution levels and identifying unexpected pollution irregularities and spikes in environmental data. By utilizing datasets aggregated from multiple sources, the proposed system aims to provide an extensive real-time overview of air quality trends. The system would primarily utilize machine learning models to reach accurate predictions of key air quality indices (e.g. AQI) in different states across Nigeria.
